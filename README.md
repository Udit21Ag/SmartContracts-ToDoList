**Blockchain Basics - Solidity**

Created a simple ToDoList using Solidity that allows users to link their lists with their account and store the information of their tasks.

**Project Guidelines:**

In this project, You will develop a versatile and interactive Todo List using Solidity. The objective is to create a smart contract that enables users to manage their daily tasks efficiently on the blockchain. This project introduces fundamental Solidity concepts such as data structuring, function implementation, and user-specific data handling, while also exploring more advanced features to enrich the learning experience.

*Key Features to Implement:*

1. *Adding Tasks:*
    
    Users will have the ability to add new tasks to their personal todo list. Each task will consist of a description and a status indicator that shows whether the task is completed or still pending.
    
2. *Marking Tasks as Completed:*
    
    The contract will allow users to mark their tasks as completed, updating the taskâ€™s status within their todo list.
    
3. *Removing Tasks:*
    
    Users can remove tasks from their list once they are no longer needed, helping maintain an organized and current list.
    
4. *Task Prioritization:*
    
    Implement a system that allows users to assign priorities to tasks (e.g., high, medium, low) and sort their list based on these priorities. This feature helps users focus on their most important tasks first.
    
5. *Editing Tasks:*
    
    Users will have the capability to edit the description of existing tasks. This functionality is particularly useful for updating tasks as more information becomes available or requirements change.

6. *Viewing Tasks by Status:*
    
    Introduce a feature that filters and displays tasks based on their status (e.g., showing only completed tasks or only pending tasks). This helps users track their progress and focus on what still needs to be done.
    
7. *Setting Due Dates:*
    
    Users can assign due dates to tasks, helping them manage deadlines effectively. While this project avoids time-dependent features, due dates can still be recorded and displayed for reference, without enforcing strict deadlines.
